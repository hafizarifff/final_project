2. Which genre of anime show was popular by genre (more users)?
3. Which genre of anime show was popular by age (more users)?

The raw data can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/azathoth42/myanimelist

The collective data analysed:
- 31,092,962 list entries
- 108,711 users
- 6,668 anime
- 43 genre



## Final conclusion:

1. Yaoi (boys love) is the most highest rated by overall, but looking at the next data, this genre is dominated by women viewers. The lowest rated is kids show; the cause might be because older viewers does not find them entertaining as the other genre, thus giving it a lower score.

2. Most genre are dominated by male audiences, especially cars and ecchi (centered around female fan service). However there are some female-preferred genre too such as yaoi and shonen ai (both are centered around male fan service), which are primarily intended for female audiences. We can say that the producers of the anime successfully reached their intended gender demographics for both male and female.

3. Going by popularity, we can generally see that comedy-based anime are dominating regardless of age group, followed by action and romance. School-based anime are popular among the lower age group (younger audiences), but disappear from the top 5 as the age group increases. Sci-fi, on the other hand, is popular among the older age group. This might due to a large number of popular old anime that based on sci-fi, such as Cowboy Bebop and Gundam.
